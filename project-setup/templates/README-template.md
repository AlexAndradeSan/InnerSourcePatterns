# Insert the name of your project here

## Mission

This should contain a brief (3-5 sentences) description of the mission of your
project. The goal is to state what you are planning to work on and help external
contributors understand roughly which types of features will likely be welcome
for this project.

See also [mission statement
chapter](https://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#mission-statement) in
Producing Open Source Software.

## Getting Started

This section should contain brief documentation written for first time users on
how to get started using the project. Further more detailed documentation can be
linked to from here.

## Getting involved

This section should include information on how to get in touch with the project:
Typically this will contain links to archived, searchable and linkable
communication channels.

## Who we are

This is a good place to give credit to Trusted Committers of the project.

It's also a good place to include information on what being a Trusted Committer
means for this project - although ideally all projects in an organisation use
the same definition that is only linked to from here. The reason to keep the
link here is for colleagues who have no or little experience with working in and
contributing to InnerSource projects to have a direct link back to company wide
information from the technological projects they need for their daily work.

### How to become a Trusted Committer

This section should make the process for becoming a Trusted Committer explicit
if that route is open to contributors.

### How to nominate Trusted Committers

This section serves as a reminder to existing and explanation for new Trusted
Committers detailing how to add others to the host team. Again ideally this
information is identical for all projects in the organisation so central
information can be linked to from here. 

## Contributing

This section should document (or link to documentation) on all things that a
first time contributor needs to know to get started. Typically not all of the
topics below will be covered. Focus on what differs in your project from
standard setup and what previous contributors found hard to understand.

- Finding the source code.
- Finding a list of issues that your project needs help with - these can be
  both, technical and non-technical issues. Typically you will keep those in an
  issue tracker accessible to contributors.
- Links to further documentation e.g. about the architecture of the project,
  general coding conventions, testing conventions...
- For technical contributions: Making changes, building the project and testing
  your changes.
- Submitting your changes back to the project.

Ideally you also include information on what the preferred process for changes
looks like for the project: Should contributors first open an issue and submit a
proposal, or are they welcome to submit changes right away? What is important to
you when reviewing contributions?

Over time you will notice that this section grows substantially. In that case
think about moving the information to separate files, e.g. a CONTRIBUTING.md and
TESTING.md
