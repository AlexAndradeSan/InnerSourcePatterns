**Title:** ??  

**Statement of Problem:** 
Development does not want to spend the extra resources needed to develop modular components. As a result, shared components are not reused.  

**Context:** 
* There is no corporate mandate for modularized code.
* This is a new product/new code, not a legacy product/code. 
* There is an available repository for sharing code.
* Making code modular takes extra effort and time to develop.

**Forces:**
* There is a learning curve to writing code that can be reused.
* Extra documentation is required for reusable code.
* If you expose it, there is also the spectre of needing to provide support for it.  
* Some companies have a common components group that develops reusable code, but others feel that such components should be developed by those business lines that are using the components and a library of common components could be established.

**Resolution:**  ?  
* Provide incentives to teams to invest in modular code
* Offer education. Modular code is well-understood; there is a lot of literature in favor of this. 
* Establish a checklist of elements to be checked off to classify a component as reusable
* Select certain "success projects," teams that will develop reusable code and demonstrate the long term success

**Resulting Context:** 
Time is spent making the shared code modular so it can be reused.
