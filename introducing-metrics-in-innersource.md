# Title

Introducing Metrics in the InnerSource Initiative

# Context

An organization is applying InnerSource. This needs to check the
current status and if some of the expected outcomes are starting
to work.


# Problem

This organization may already have qualitative feedback from the
involved teams, but desire more objective information focused
on development activities.

The organization does not really know where to start measuring
things or what are the key parameters to measure.


# Forces

People do not like to be tracked or measured.

There is not a proper monitoring infrastructure for the software
development process and this is hard to build or to get funding
for this.

There is not a culture of software development metrics.

Metrics are usually misunderstood if people have not received any
training on those.


# Solution

Bring developers, middle managers and C-level to have a discussion
about metrics.

Let developers and middle managers know that these metrics or KPIs
are not focused on tracking their personal performance, but to compare
if the initiative is currently working as expected.

Have specific training on the topic of metrics and good practices
to use them.

Bring specific discussions on the metrics to be used avoiding per
developer granularity or at least anonymizing that info.


# Resulting Context

The organization builds a monitoring infrastructure where the agreed
metrics will be the ones to be used.

Those metrics will help C-level to understand the current situation
of the project and this will help to compare the status before
applying inner source and after applying the inner source initiative.

Those metrics will help middle management to understand how the
initiative evolves and help them with their daily work.

Those metrics will help developers to understand how the initiative
evolves and help them with their daily work.
