# Title

Start as an Experiment

# Problem

An InnerSource initiative is considered but not started because management is 
unsure about its outcome and, as a result, is not willing to commit to an 
investment.

# Context

The majority of software development projects in the company are distributed
globally. The company is considering to leverage InnerSource to make the
required collaboration more efficient. However, most managers are not familiar
with the Open Source working model and are instead accustomed to hierarchical,
top-down control style management. The idea of InnerSource is very popular with
software developers in the company, not the least because many developers use
or are actively developing Open Source software.

# Forces

- Managers will want to validate the claims of improved collaboration through
  InnerSource before making a long term investment. This usually involves
  putting numbers against the expected improvements, which are hard to come
  by for InnerSource.
- If the InnerSource initiative has a huge uptake among developers and if many
  projects come to rely on it, a decision to shut it down will be very 
  unpopular and therefore hard to make.
- When implementing new working models such as InnerSource which are radically
  different from working models previously practiced in the company, it is 
  likely that existing, mandatory processes are no longer applicable and even
  that one has to operate in a regulatory, sometimes legal no-mans land.

# Solution

Declare the InnerSource initiative as a time limited experiment. Define and
communicate the criteria for evaluating the experiment and ensure that 
sufficient data is gathered to perform the evaluation. Consider establishing
a _Review Committee_ (**tbd**: pattern link) to increase the chances of 
management buy-in.

# Resulting Context

Managers are able to kick start InnerSource for the following reasons:

- The experimental setup eases the need to management to scrutinize their
  numbers in the same way that they would for typical projects.
- The possibility of failure of the experiment is understood and accepted. The
  personal risk for the supporting managers is minimized.
- Even in case of a failure, the setup ensures that the company will learn from
  the experiment.
- In case of success, the data gathered during the experiment will allow
  managers to make a longer lasting commitment to InnerSource. 

Participants in the InnerSource experiment are conscious of the fact that, as
an experiment, the InnerSource initiative could be shut down or not continued
after the planned lifetime in case the experiment does not yield the expected 
results.

Finally, starting as an experiment makes it much easier to bend and adapt the 
existing processes and rules before you break them.
