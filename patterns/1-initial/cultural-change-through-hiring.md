## FIXME
THESE ARE DRAFT NOTES; Nick needs to go through them and take out what is important and decide on whether to make a pattern here, or some kind of other document.

## Notes
Ramping up inner source; semi-existant

On-boarding guidelines

HR is affected by inner source
Problem: How to sustain the inner source culture, even once new hires come in. How to keep existing employees who support and encourage inner source? Filling the ranks with new innersource-friendly and innersource-excited hires can be difficult.
Company perception is drab and boring engineering culture; large company



## Problem
Keep everyone updated on how the communities work, both from culture and technology perspective.
Company is not attractive, or people are leaving, or hiring is difficult.
Company has trouble attracting developers who are intersted in open source and inner source.

Innersource projects have an issue getting enough employees who are natively able of inner source / open source methodologies.

Inner source as a concept is not well known

## Benefits
(seperate document?)
Inner source can be a selling point.
Innersource is going, but we are not intetionally leveriging in HR strategy.
  **Recruiting - more interesting**
  Engagement of existing/Retention - "do innersource"

10% time is not taken up and used; sometimes cutlure is only taken up by hiring the right people

## Context
Where does the problem exist? what are the pre-conditions? **Unchangeable** before the solution goes into place. The content here is often tied to applicability of other readers: "Do I have this same particular situation?"


Work done on IS was not part of oifficial performance review because HR was not on board.

Context:
Be prurpsoeful aboutlooping HR both in recruiting and retnetion phase of employee engagement.
There is successful IS happening but HR is not engaged or promoting.

End Context:
IS inteitonally looped in during all HR interations.
