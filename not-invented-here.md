## Title

Not Invented Here

## Problem

High quality solutions are being rejected due to the "Not Invented Here" mindset. Engineers and their managers are choosing to rewrite the same functionality even though an alternative exists.
Impact: Duplicative development, Cost, Redundancy, Missed opportunities for knowledge transfer, Slower time to market, Quality impact (potential to miss out on leveraging superior technology).

## Context
*Where does the problem exist? what are the pre-conditions?*
* Traditional development teams lack experience and knowledge of community engagement.
* Company has silos.
* Excess of ownership culture.
* Little to no history using open source.

## Forces
*What makes the problem difficult? What are the trade-offs? These are constraints that can be changed at a cost.*
* Lack of trust. Limited opportunities to build relationships and trust with Developers outside of their particular area.
* Strong egos (team or individual).
* Unwillingness or reluctance to work with others.
* Concern that contributions from non-team members might be of inferior quality.
* Concerns related to time constraints. Project Managers need to to deliver the project in alignment with schedule committments.
* Belief that learning and implementing something new will take away from the prime directive.
* No incentive to contribute or even consume because it is counter to their KPIs. 
* Software may not be modular/designed for reuse. Team writing the code is not positioned to accept innersource contributions.
* Fear of losing control. 
* Security can be a problem.

## Solutions
*Verified resolutions and possible resolutions to the problem*
* [Blog article from Oana-Maria Pop on going deep into the not-invented-here syndrome](http://blog.hypeinnovation.com/the-not-invented-here-syndrome) touches on this topic, describing a prescription for overcoming the "Not Invented Here" mindset: 
    - "Acknowledge that the "Not Invented Here" mindset (NIH) exists
    - Assess the impact of NIH on your innovation efforts. For example, have you missed opportunities?
    - Build in explicit incentives to overcome NIH
    - engage people outside of the organization in strategy/evaluation phases for fresh perspectives"
* DMS video [Open Innovation: Proudly Found Elsewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNNz9poyKJs): Discusses the shift from strict NIH to empowering the "Proudly Found Elsewhere" approach. "It pays to look outside ones area (open innovation). The open Innovation funnel has permeable walls-->greater chance of success, greater speed."


## Desired Resulting Context
What is the situation after the problem has been solved?
Developers search for and leverage existing options as opposed to rewriting. This results in: increased efficiency, increased reuse, higher levels of developer satisfaction, increased speed to market.
