## Title

Not Invented Here

## Problem

Perfectly good solutions are being rejected because of Not Invented Here. Engineers and their managers will choose to implement functionality themselves first, even if an alternative exists.
As a result, developers incur costs and time, resulting in redundant solutions.
Impact: duplicative development, redundancy, reinventing the wheel, not learning the lessons from other solutions, slower time to market, missing out on better technology.

## Context
*Where does the problem exist? what are the pre-conditions?*
* Traditional development teams not used to how open communities can work.
* Strong silos in the company.
* Excess of ownership culture.
* Little to no history using open source

## Forces
*What makes the problem difficult? What are the trade-offs? These are constraints that can be changed at a cost.*
* Strong egos (team or individual).
* Unwillingness to work with others.
* Belief or reality that there is excessive time pressure; learning something new will take away from the prime directive.
* No incentive to contribute or even consume (they are measured a certain way)
* Lack of trust.
* Maybe the software cannot be reused (not designed for reuse). Can the team doing the code accept innersource contributions? Lack of modularity may make them brittle.
* Fear of losing control (e.g., PjM want to deliver their project on time)
* Security can be a problem.

## Solutions
*Verified resolutions and possible resolutions to the problem*
* [Blog article from Oana-Maria Pop on going deep into the not-invented-here syndrome](http://blog.hypeinnovation.com/the-not-invented-here-syndrome) touches on this topic: a prescription for NIH: 
    -acknowledge that NIH exists
    - assess its impact on your innovation efforts (how many opportunities missed)
    - build in explicit incentives to overcome NIH
    - engage people outside of the organization in strategy/evaluation phases for fresh perspectives
* DMS video [Open Innovation: Proudly Found Elsewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNNz9poyKJs): shift from strict NIH to empowering Proudly Found Elsewhere approach. Pays to look outside ones area (open innovation). Open Innovation funnel has permeable walls-->greater chance of success, greater speed.
* *Christian will contribute some thoughts*

## Desired Resulting Context
What is the situation after the problem has been solved

## Rationale (optional)  

## Known instances (optional)  

## Status  
Brainstormed solution (not proven), a donut (no solution), a proven solution, a reviewed pattern, an untested idea, an unreviewed draft of a proven solution

## Author(s)
Often, this is yourself; If you need to, find someone in the InnerSource Commons to be the nominal author (As Told To); Could also be no-one if you do not want to take on authorship (common with a donut looking for a solution)

## Acknowledgements (optional)
Include those who assisted in helping with this pattern - both for attribution and for possible future follow up
