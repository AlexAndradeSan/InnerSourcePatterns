This repository serves as the collection-point, ideation hub, and process behind the [InnerSource Commons'](http://innersourcecommons.com) set of proven and reviewed InnerSource approaches (patterns). These patterns illustrate beneficial activities and behaviors found in [organizations who apply InnerSource methodologies](http://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/getting-started/).

What are Inner Source Patterns?
===============================

Patterns are a way of describing a repeatable, proven solution to a problem with a context. They follow a simple form that helps people wanting to implement the solution to understand the constraints on the problem, the forces that must be balanced and the resulting context (the situation you are left with after the solution is applied). In inner sourcing, patterns can provide a way for the InnerSource Commons participants to concisely share information with each other, improving the practice of inner sourcing. Each of the patterns are divided into Title, Context, Problem Statement, Forces, and Solutions as their main sections.

How can you use Inner Source Patterns?
======================================

Patterns must be used in a thoughtful manner. They cannot be blindly applied. In most cases, you will need to adapt the given solution to your own situation; but the information given in the pattern, defining the context (immovable constraints) and forces (constraints that can be changed and balanced against each other), should help you do this.

The pattern form is useful for describing proven patterns but it could also be used for *brainstorming solutions* where patterns are not yet established, since the form gives a structured way for thinking about a problem. You could also create a *donut pattern* (filling in the problem, context, forces and resulting context fields but leaving the solution blank) as a way of asking the InnerSource Commons community for help (to find a proven solution or to brainstorm things to try).


How can you get answers and join the discussion?
================================================

Contribute. If you want to expand your InnerSource knowledge, the best way is to join us. We encourage beginners seeking answers to jump in by creating ''donuts'' (see above). Anyone can offer reviews and comments for in-progress patterns.

We work together via github, phone-meetings, Slack, etc. Do not hesitate to join the [#innersourcecommons](https://isc-inviter.herokuapp.com/) slack channel and ask to be included in the patterns meetings.
