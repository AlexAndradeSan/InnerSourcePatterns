## Title

* Gig Marketplace

## Patlet

InnerSource projects at your company are finding it difficult to attract contributors.  

Establish a marketplace by creating an intranet website that list specific InnerSource project needs as "gigs" with explicit time and skill requirements.
This will enable managers to better understand their employee’s time commitment and professional benefits thereby increasing the likelihood of garnering approval to make InnerSource contributions.

## Problem

There is no single, uniform way for InnerSource project owners and potential contributors to discover each other. 
It is difficult for employees to communicate to their management what commitment of time they will need to make to an InnerSource project and how they will benefit.  
Managers have no uniform way of keeping track of or rewarding their employee’s involvement in InnerSource projects.

## Story
 
You’ve successfully created an InnerSource program at your company and have buy-in from senior management, middle-management and developers.  However, after nearly a year there have been few actual contributions made to any InnerSource projects outside of the teams that originally created them.  After interviewing all the parties involved the main sticking point seems to be that it is difficult to know what the exact level of commitment developers will be asked to make if they choose to get involved in an InnerSource project. There is also no uniform way of advertising what opportunities for contributors exist, what they’ll be asked to do and approximately how long it might take.  Managers are supportive and want their employees to participate but so far have lacked a way of documenting and accounting for their employees’ activities within InnerSource projects.  What can be done to improve this situation for all the parties involved (InnerSource project owners, potential contributors and development managers)? 

## Forces

* There are multiple engineering teams in your organization but few channels through which they can effectively partner on shared challenges.
* It is difficult for individuals to discover what InnerSource opportunities exist across the entire company.
* InnerSource project owners have no clearly defined channel through which to advertise their projects to potential contributors.
* Individuals have been given some time by their management to get involved in InnerSource projects of their choosing.
* It is difficult for managers to approximate what the time/effort commitment will be for employees taking on InnerSource project tasks.
* The less insight a manager has into the effort and accomplishment of their employees in InnerSource projects, the more unlikely it is that he can reward their employees for their InnerSource work.
* The transparency and reputational aspect of the code submissions within a large company should work to keep the code quality high for InnerSource contributions.
* Individual employees may commit themselves to InnerSource project tasks without first getting approval from their manager or having the skills or time required to complete it.

## Context

* Part of a manager's job is tracking, estimating and understanding use of employee time
* Managers have given tacit acceptance that their employees should take part in InnerSource projects
* There is no corporate policy on employee’s involvement in InnerSource projects
* Employees desire the freedom to work on projects that are of interest to or would professionally benefit them
* Employees desire being recognized for their efforts when contributing to InnerSource projects
* Employees desire exposure to different areas within and to work with a larger pool of people across the company

## Solutions

Create a “gig” based intranet site where individuals can advertise their skills and areas of interest and project owners can advertise opportunities for collaboration.  Each gig should describe exactly the skill and time requirements needed so those can be easily and clearly communicated to an employee’s direct management.  A points based system should be created to reward and track an employee’s involvement in a gig. Points accrued by completing a gig can then be used as performance management criteria and to garner insight in to the areas of expertise that exist within an organization. All gigs are initially vetted with the Gig owner to determine that the employee has the prerequisite skills and allotted time and needed access to complete the gig.  Gigs can also factor in soft skills such as garnering help organizing a group event or requesting help editing/writing a report or requests for mentorship etc.

## Resulting Context

The InnerSource Gig Marketplace has vastly increased the number of possibilities for InnerSource opportunities. The self-directed nature of Gig Marketplace has enhanced job satisfaction amongst employees by allowing them a level of choice in the work they perform and with whom they can partner across the company. Managers are able to better estimate and track their employee’s time commitments with respect to InnerSource projects, recognize their individual efforts and use the completion of gigs as a way of validating their specific skillsets.  Managers are also able to leverage any existing downtime their employees may be experiencing by allowing them to pivot to work available in the Gig Marketplace.
